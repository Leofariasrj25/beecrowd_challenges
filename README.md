# Beecrowd Challenges

if you want to be good at something you should spend at least 10,000 hours of practice. this is one of the ways I'm doing it.

Beecrowd is platform focused on coding challenges, personally, one of its main attractions is its huge respository of challenges separated by clear
categories ranging from beginner problems, strings, data strucutres, etc and following a logical path.
